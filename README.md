# Chat Personal Trainer

A React Native mobile app concept that delivers personalized training plans and coaching via a conversational interface backed by the ChatGPT API.

## Vision
Build an always-available personal trainer that can:

- create personalized training plans based on goals, equipment, schedule, and experience,
- provide real-time coaching and form cues through chat,
- adapt plans using check-ins and progress metrics,
- support habit-building with reminders and streaks.

## Planned Features
- Onboarding flow to capture goals, limitations, equipment, and availability.
- Daily workout generator with warm-up, main sets, and cooldown.
- Progress tracking (workouts completed, volume, PRs, body metrics).
- Recovery & rest guidance (sleep, soreness, readiness).
- Safety guardrails and clear disclaimers.

## Tech Stack (Planned)
- **React Native** (app)
- **TypeScript** (app code)
- **ChatGPT API** (coach logic)
- **SQLite** or **AsyncStorage** (local data)
- Optional backend for sync & analytics
